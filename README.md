# StarCraft II Reinforcement Learning Agent

In this repository, I explore and utilize reinforcement learning techniques to build agents that can strategically play and survive in StarCraft II environments.

ðŸš§WORK IN PROGRESSðŸš§

## Progress

### Rule-based
1. Building a single Nexus and Probes: Approximately 2000 iterations
2. Building multiples Nexuses, Probes, Pylons, and Photon cannons: Approximately 4000 iterations
3. Above + Assimilators (for Vespene Gas), Gateways, Cybernetics core, Void Rays : Victory in approximately 3500-4000 iterations for Protoss vs Zerg (AI Hard)

### Deep learning
